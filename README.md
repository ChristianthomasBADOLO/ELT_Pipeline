# Amazon Books Analytics ETL Pipeline with Snowflake

## Description
A robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for analyzing Amazon book data, leveraging the powerful Snowflake cloud platform.

## Key Features:
- Web scraping of Amazon book data using BeautifulSoup
- Pipeline orchestration with Apache Airflow in a Docker environment
- Intermediate data storage in PostgreSQL
- Data loading into Snowflake (in development)
- Scalable architecture designed for large Amazon book datasets
- Planned future integration with Power BI for visualization and reporting

This project showcases modern data engineering practices, providing deep insights into Amazon book trends. It's ideal for data engineers, market analysts, and businesses looking to harness the full potential of e-commerce data for strategic decision-making.

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
- Apache Airflow for orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- PostgreSQL for intermediate storage
- Snowflake for data storage and analysis (integration in progress)
- Power BI for visualization (planned)

This pipeline demonstrates best practices in web data extraction, workflow orchestration, and cloud-based data warehousing.

## In Development
- Full integration with Snowflake for data storage and analysis
- Utilization of Power BI to create reports and visualizations from collected data

## Installation and Usage
(To be completed with specific instructions for installing and running the project, including Docker and Airflow configuration)

## Airflow DAG Structure
(Add here a description of your Airflow DAG structure, the tasks it includes, and how they are sequenced)

## Next Steps
